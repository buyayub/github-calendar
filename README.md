### github-calendar
A python3 script that gets github's calendar from a user's page. I have back-end in mind, updating it once a day for my blog. Feel free to take.

Features so far:

+ Get from user page and print the svg output (you'll have to edit it a little to get it to work)

Things to add:

+ Get calendar by user & year
+ Allow rudimentary svg manipulation of the calendar
+ Parsing
+ Finding it in a more reliable way than string matching
+ Optimization
+ Organization
